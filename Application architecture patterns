Application architecture patterns:
==================================

Monolithic architecture - architect an application as a single deployable unit
Microservice architecture - architect an application as a collection of loosely coupled, services

MIRCOSERVICES:
=============

	> easily deployable
	> loosely coupled
	> owned by small team
	> orgainized into small chuks into whole business capablity

DORA metrics:
============
Developed by the authors of Accelerate, the DORA metrics measure the performance of a software development teams:

Deployment frequency - the frequency with which software changes are deployed to production.
Lead time for changes - the time it takes to go from commit to deploy.
Time to restore service - the time it takes to restore service after a production incident or outage.
Change failure rate - the percentage of production deployments that result in a failure or require remediation.
